# Houses serve as the population model
# Levels and represented population (1000 * 2^(x-1)):
# S1: 1000
# S2: 2000
# S3: 4000
# S4: 8000
# M1: 16000
# M2: 32000
# M3: 64000
# M4: 128000
# L1: 256000
# L2: 512000
# L3: 1024000
# L4: 2048000
#
# Development growth shall increase with the logarithm of the population
# The levy size should be proportional to the population
# The cost of the building should be proportional to increase in population over the previous level
# The construction time should be less the root of the logarthm of the population
# The supply limit should be proportional to the population
# The monthly income should be proportional to the population
#
# Poor housing should have a base income of 0.05 (1k population)
# Decent housing should have a base income of x1.3 (0.065)
# Good housing should have a base income of x1.9 (0.095)
# Great housing should have a base income of x2.8 (0.14)
# Housing quality is independent of population
# Housing quality represents the living standards of the population
# Construction cost for 1k population for every quality level should be:
# Poor: 10
# Medium: 20
# Good: 40
# Great: 70
# This means about 40 years of income for poor housing
#
# For every 1000 in population there should be:
# 1 levy
# 100 supply limit
#
